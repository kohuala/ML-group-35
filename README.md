## Project Aim and Problem Fumulation

We would like to make the parking easier by automatically detecting the license plates instead of distributing physical tickets when car entering or exiting the parking lot.

## Technology Overview

* First Step:Â We used SVM to train the model
* Second Step: We used connected region method to extract and segment the LP
* Third Step: We used the trained model to recognize the character 
* Fourth Step: We registered or delisted the LP into a csv file.

## Evaluation

To be continued
