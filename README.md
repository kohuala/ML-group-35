## Project Aim and Problem Fumulation

We would like to make the parking easier by automatically detecting the license plates instead of distributing physical tickets when cars enter or exit the parking lot.

## Technology Overview

* First Step:Â We used SVM to train the model
* Second Step: We used connected region method to extract and segment the LP
* Third Step: We used the trained model to recognize characters
* Fourth Step: We registered or delisted the estimated LP into a csv file

## Evaluation

To be continued
